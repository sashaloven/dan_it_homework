1.  - In unicast transmissions, a single data packet is sent from a source to 
    a single destination on the network.
    - In multicast transmissions, a single data packet is copied and sent to 
    specific destinations on the network
    - In multicast transmissions, a single data packet is copied and sent to 
    specific destinations on the network

2. Network Access Layer:
   • Exchange of data between the computer and the network
   • Sending computer provides address of destination
   • May need specific drivers and interface equipment depending on type of network used.

3. Transport Layer:
   ● Reliable(надійний) data exchange
    ○ to make sure that all the data packets arrived in the same order(порядку) in which they are sent out
    ○ Packets not received(отримані) or received in error are retransmitted(повторно передаються)
   ● Independent of network being used
   ● Independent of application

4. Application Layer
    ● Support for different user applications
    ● e.g. e-mail, file transfer  

5. Protocol Data Units (PDU)
   ● User data is passed from layer to layer
   ● Control information is added/removed to/from user data at each layer
    ○ Header (and sometimes trailer)
    ○ each layer has a different header/trailer
   ● Data + header + trailer = PDU (Protocol Data Unit)
    ○ This is basically what we call packet
    ○ each layer has a different PDU
