The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model is a 
simplified and practical framework used for internet and network communication.
It consists of 4 layers, which correspond closely to the OSI model:

1. Network Interface Layer
    Purpose: Handles the physical transmission of data between devices and ensures communication 
    on the same network.
    Example: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, MAC addressing.
    Equivalent OSI Layers: Physical + Data Link.

2. Internet Layer
    Purpose: Manages logical addressing, routing, and forwarding of data across networks.
    Example: IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP, ARP.
    Equivalent OSI Layer: Network.

3. Transport Layer
    Purpose: Ensures end-to-end communication, data delivery, error checking, and flow control.
    Example: TCP (reliable) and UDP (unreliable).
    Equivalent OSI Layer: Transport.

4. Application Layer
    Purpose: Provides protocols and services for end-user applications to interact with the network.
    Example: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.
    Equivalent OSI Layers: Session + Presentation + Application.
