1. Linux Kernel
The Linux kernel is the core part of the operating system that manages hardware resources
(CPU, memory, devices) and provides essential services for software applications.
It handles process management, memory allocation, device communication, file systems, and networking.
As a monolithic and modular kernel, it allows dynamic loading of modules, and its open-source nature
enables customization and wide hardware compatibility.
uname -r

/bin - System binaries, including the command
/boot - The files necessary for the system to boot
/dev - Device files for all your peripherals,  that your Linux system uses to talk to your hardware
/etc -  Contains system-wide configuration files and shell scripts used to manage system settings and services
/home - This is where users store their files
/library - System libraries. Libraries are just bunches (набор) of programming code that the programs on your
system use to get things done
/opt - is used to store optional or third-party software that is not part of the default installation.
